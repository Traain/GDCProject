describe11_7998106e	Narrator	Early researchers hadn’t known about this, and put far too much energy into a portal to an energetically accessible location, creating a much bigger portal than intended. This knowledge allows much safer exploration of micro portals.	game/script.rpy	258

describe12_d621490a	Narrator	Certain close allies to the US join the effort, sending top minds and resources to XEDRA facilities across North America.	game/script.rpy	283
describe12_cb5ae43e	Narrator	Not long after, XEDRA facility in the Northwest reports a major sample stolen. Counterintelligence identifies China as the most likely culprit, and backtraces the theft to hypothesize that significant XEDRA research data was compromised.	game/script.rpy	285
describe12_01065590	Narrator	New protocols are put in place to counter XFS equipped intelligence agents, including advanced robotic security managed by Melchior.	game/script.rpy	287
describe12_16e7a661	Narrator	Later, XEDRA is broken into several connected but distinct agencies. In several of these agencies, desperate to catch up for time now lost by presumed stolen research, reasonable safety protocols are dropped in favour of Melchior predictions of immediate repercussions.	game/script.rpy	289
describe12_37384331	Narrator	This has the obvious (especially in hindsight) flaw that anything that does not have immediate repercussions will be missed: there are few lab explosions, but the Blob is able to leverage this weakness.	game/script.rpy	291
